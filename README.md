# Discontinued

After careful consideration, i dont have the time to completely port this entire project to x64 by myself, i wont be working on this anymore, if someone wants to take over probably best to fork or something, AFAIK the original SKSE team is already working for a skyrim special edition version anyway. Best to probably wait for that

# SKSE
Adding support for SSE to base SKSE (hopefully, WIP)

The source included is based off the work of the SKSE team: http://skse.silverlock.org/
All credits for the initial source code go to them.
You can download the same source i used in this project from their website here: http://skse.silverlock.org/beta/skse_1_07_03.7z (src directory obvs)
